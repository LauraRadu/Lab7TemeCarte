//Create a program that prompts for a quote and an author.
//        Display the quotation and author as shown in the example
//        output.
//        Modify this program so that
//        instead of prompting for quotes from the user, you create
//        a structure that holds quotes and their associated
//        attributions and then display all of the quotes using the
//        format in the example. An array of maps would be a
//        good choice.
